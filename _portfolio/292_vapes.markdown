sometimes you find yourself wondering about odd things. recently in hampton roads, it seems that giant plumes of vapor
permeate just about everywhere. shops dedicated to vape or e-cigs have also seemed to crop up along the main thoroughfares throughout the region. i was curious enough to actually find out if there are as many vape shops across the state, as there are here locally.

<br>
ultimately i ended up using [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/), mostly to use the tilt perspective of GL with a vapor-cloud styled heat map effect. and without plugging Mapbox too too much - i really just streamed together several examples like [heatmap](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/heatmap/) and a few others.

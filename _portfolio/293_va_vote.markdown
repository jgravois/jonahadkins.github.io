The Commonwealth of Virginia is redrawing new congressional districts to reduce unconstitutional gerrymandering that packed black voters in the 3rd Congressional District and reduce their numbers in other districts.  

This open-source web application allows Virginians to browse the submissions that redraw the districts.

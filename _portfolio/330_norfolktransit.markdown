I’ve always wanted to do a real transit map, but unfortunately I live in one of the most transit-boring regions of the U.S..

The main focus is the new light-rail line (The Tide), and it’s connectivity with the existing bus transportation system. I was excited that light-rail was coming to the region, and bummed when I saw the map. Included on this map is the new Amtrack NE Regional train which originates from the downtown area,  Greyhound Bus routes, and all of the connecting arterial bus routes.

i initially had the idea for this when i first purchased the Illinois album way back in 2005. It’s not everyday geography and music collide. The Illinois album is probably one of my top 5 favorite albums ever. Oh, how i wish the 50 states project was a real thing. After pouring over countless websites, lyrics, pictures, i think i’ve incorporated nearly every geographic component off of the two albums. There were many different drafts of directions i could have gone with this map, but i eventually decided on this finished product.

The map is available for purchase at<a href="https://society6.com/product/the-geography-of-illinoise_print#1=45" target="_blank"> my Society 6 store </a>.

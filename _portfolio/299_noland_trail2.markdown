About 2 years ago I created the <a href= "http://jonahsmaps.tumblr.com/post/55516350234/the-noland-trail-is-a-well-known-park-in-newport" target="_blank">first edition</a>, unofficial map of the Noland Trail. It was side project of mine to create an all inclusive complete map of the park and trail. I threw a ton of information on the first one, probably too much and it had many ‘GIS-y’ type elements that were lost on the casual map viewer. With this second edition, I wanted to strip away the bulkiness of the original, maintain a high level of detail, and improve the original design.

The second edition uses data I collected and <a href= "http://jonahadkins.github.io/open-noland-trail/" target="_blank">open-sourced</a>, and topographic data from <a href= "http://www.opentopography.org" target="_blank">OpenTopography.org</a>. The map is available for purchase, along with the 1st edition at <a href="https://society6.com/product/the-noland-trail-2nd-edition_print#1=1" target="_blank"> my Society 6 store </a>.

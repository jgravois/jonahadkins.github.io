	The inspiration for this map/project came from a) being a `huge` jenny lewis
	fan & b) this promo shot (right) from 'The Voyager'. I was able to do some
	scraping of tour dates from various places, and heavy use of rainbow
	colors from her trademark rainbow suit. Created in QGIS and Adobe Photoshop,
	this map even got a retweet from the queen herself! Iâ€™ve made this available as a print at <a href="https://society6.com/product/the-voyager-ndh_print#1=1" target="_blank"> my Society 6 store </a> and is a natural fit at 17x22, but will look great at any printed size!

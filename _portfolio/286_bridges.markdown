back in 2013, i made "Virginia: Bridges of the Commonwealth" for a map contest using National Bridge Inventory data. the static map won a few awards (!!!) which is always nice, and it was an interesting project given the amount odd bridge facts i gathered from the data. (like the skinniest bridge in virginia is 6.8 feet wide)

while my project was limited to Virginia, the data definitely called out for a cool web map version. after a few years of that idea floating around, i got a gentle nudge from a friend that it _would_ be a cool project, especially if i used [tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe).

[Read a lot more about this project here.](http://jonahadkins.github.io/2016/03/22/bridges_of_america.html) and [check out the interactive map](http://jonahadkins.github.io/bridges.html)

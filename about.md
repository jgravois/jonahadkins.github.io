Hi! my name is Jonah Adkins. I am a cartographer from Newport News, Virginia. I have been working with GIS technology since 1999, learning and applying my skillsets with local governments, federal agencies, and recently as a consultant.

I'm most interested in cartographic design, OpenStreetMap, and civic hacking.

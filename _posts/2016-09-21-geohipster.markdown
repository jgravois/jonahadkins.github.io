Over at [GeoHipster](http://geohipster.com), we just announced the call for maps for the 2017 edition of our GeoHipster calendar. This is the third year for the **must-have-workspace-accessory** and we want it to be a great one. New this year are dedicated spots for undergrad / student works, which is a great resume opportunity for those heading out into the job market.  

As part of the call, I created this map (above) as an example of the fun, anything is possible nature of map topics. And if you are part of the acute society of angle truthers, i especially want to see your post-scalene incident maps of the new united states!

See the [official rules](http://geohipster.com/2017-geohipster-calendar/) for more information.

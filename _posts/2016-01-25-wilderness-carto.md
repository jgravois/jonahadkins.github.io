It's our first Disney trip of 2016! We're on the way to Port Canaveral for a 4 night cruise on the Disney Dream, so I thought I'd share a few pics from our first 2 nights at Disney's Wilderness Lodge.  

Maps are prominently featured across Disney Park's and Resorts. To the normal vacationer, park maps are great for finding your way around and getting to that character dining experience on time. To the cartographic eye, maps are used throughout to help tell the story of a ride or provide a reference for a themed resort. Below are a few from Disney's Wilderness Lodge:

**Scenic Line of the West** *- as seen in the main lobby of the Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge. Great character pictorial symbols on this standard map of the continental U.S.*

**Wilderness Lodge Resort** *- locator map for our resort, features a dark green/orange color palette, with great legend symbols for forest and geothermal areas. Wave/hachure lines are a nice bonus too!*

**Territory Lounge** *- wall size map for the surveyor's themed Territory Lounge - awesome illustrative style map of land rush era Utah with journal entry notes.*

[Yesterday](https://blog.mapbox.com/1-million-registered-developers-d7723ff75d1d), Mapbox hit 1,000,000 registered developers. WOW.  

To celebrate they started the [#1millionexploring](https://twitter.com/hashtag/1millionexploring?src=hash) hashtag on Twitter, which asks users to share their memories or milestones using Mapbox software. That got me thinking back to my first Mapbox project.

I had been hearing about TileMill online, and decided to take a crack at CartoCSS for the first time. Using my "Greetings from the Island" map I had recently (2013-ish) created I began the several hour process of scouring Tilemill docs and lots of googling.

"Greetings from the Island" - 2013

To my surprise yesterday, my original Tilemill project was still in my Mapbox account, so I brought it in to Studio to make a quick style from the raster tiles.

Take a trip back to 2013, Tilemill, and my first Mapbox map with  [The Island](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/jonahadkins/cjdf4doi4f66t2sq3piiggcay.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoiam9uYWhhZGtpbnMiLCJhIjoiRlVVVkx3VSJ9.9sdVEK_B_VkEXPjssU5MqA#10/4.4071/162.2798).  
**Congrats Mapbox!** 👏 🚀 👏 🚀 👏 🚀 👏 🚀

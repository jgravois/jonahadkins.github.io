tl;dr  [Back 2 School 2: Projection Boogaloo](http://jonahadkins.com/back2school2.html)

<hr>

[A few years ago](http://jonahadkins.com/cartography/mapbox/2015/12/08/purp-tape.html), I put together a cartographic mixtape called "The Purple Mixtape: Mapbox Studio Sessions". A play on the legendary cassette version of Raekwon the Chef's "Only Built for Cuban Linx". One of the tracks/maps focused on a map I had recently purchased from a vintage shop, and [old classroom style map](https://www.instagram.com/p/9CBXvmiBQi/). I called it [Back to School](http://jonahadkins.com/noland-trail-gl/back2school.html)

Since I started using ArcGIS Pro, and learning it can create vector tiles in any projection, I wanted to go back to "Back To School" and recreate the map in its native projection, Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area.

This was a fairly easy task involving creating a zoom scheme, and vector tile index using the custom projection for each. After the tiles were published, I had to clean-up a few label issues, but overall they came out pretty clean.

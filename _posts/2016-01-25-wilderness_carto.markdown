description: various maps at Disney's Wilderness Lodge

It's our first Disney trip of 2016! We're on the way to Port Canaveral for a 4 night cruise on the Disney Dream, so I thought I'd share a few pics from our first 2 nights at Disney's Wilderness Lodge.  

Maps are prominently featured across Disney Park's and Resorts. To the normal vacationer, park maps are great for finding your way around and getting to that character dining experience on time. To the cartographic eye, maps are used throughout to help tell the story of a ride or provide a reference for a themed resort.  

Below are a few from Disney's Wilderness Lodge:

  bonus too!

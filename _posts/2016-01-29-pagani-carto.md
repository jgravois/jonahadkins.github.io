Back to the land of free wi-fi! Our Disney cruise was [absolutely a blast](http://www.instagram.com/jonahadkins), and the per-megabyte charge for internet kept relaxation at a maximum :) . Continuing on the theme of great cartography at Disney, here are some pics from the Pangani Forest Exploration Trail at Disney's Animal Kindgom park.

**Gorilla Valley** *- an overview of the trail using a neat marker drawn style.*

**Bushmeat Overhunting: An African Crisis** *- woah! a GIS style map of overhunting areas. Nice fonts for the ocean names, with a random letter-number index overlaid on the whole thing.*

**Lowland Gorilla Activity Patterns** *- a hand drawn inset to the "Gorilla Valley" map above. The areas of rock feature some nice symbology and the highlight has to be the illustrative Gorillas.*

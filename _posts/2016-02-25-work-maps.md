Hello from DC! I'm in town for the Esri Federal Users Conference this week. One of the projects I work on is for the Navy's energy program - we help track energy consumption
for every naval facility in the world. every once in awhile i get the opportunity to make some data-viz-type-posters to help simply show how crucial this information is.  

![fed1]({{ site.url }}/static/projects/fed16_nsn.jpg)  

*This is take on small multiples for several common metrics at Naval Station Norfolk.*

*In this viz, total consumption is shown by region, a geographic area that groups navy installations. The stream-graph shows the overall rise in consumption has data starts being tracked, and the eventual tapering off as reduction measures are introduced.*

*On this one, each of these region graphs show the performance of all facilities across time.*

I recently was able to collaborate with my local running shop [Point2 Running Company](https://runpoint2.com/) on a new version of my [noland trail map](http://jonahadkins.github.io/portfolio/299_noland_trail2/). most importantly this version was going to be hung for all to see in their store! while it didn't require too many changes, the layout was drastically changed from 24x36 to 30x72 to accommodate their space.  
i must say it's pretty **awesome** to see something i made in a public setting like this. :)

last fall, I had the opportunity to get a sneak peek of the new American Panorama project
from the Richmond Scholars Lab and Stamen. The series of next level interactive maps is
partly based off of the "Atlas of Historical Geography of the United States", which contains
page after page of topic driven maps that cover multiple centuries of time.

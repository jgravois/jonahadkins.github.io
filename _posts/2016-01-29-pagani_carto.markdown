Back to the land of free wi-fi! Our Disney cruise was [absolutely a blast](http://www.instagram.com/jonahadkins), and
the per-megabyte charge for internet kept relaxation at a maximum :) . Continuing on the theme
of great cartography at Disney, here are some pics from the Pangani Forest Exploration Trail at
Disney's Animal Kindgom park.

	`Bushmeat Overhunting: An African Crisis` - woah! a GIS style map of overhunting areas. Nice fonts
	for the ocean names, with a random letter-number index overlaid on the whole thing.

<div class="col three caption">
	`Lowland Gorilla Activity Patterns` - a hand drawn inset to the `Gorilla Valley` map above. The areas of rock
	feature some nice symbology and the highlight has to be the illustrative Gorillas.

hello from DC! i'm in town for the Esri Federal Users Conference this week. one of the
projects i work on is for the Navy's energy program - we help track energy consumption
for every naval facility in the world. every once in awhile i get the opportunity to
make some data-viz-type-posters to help simply show how crucial this information is.

	In this viz, total consumption is shown by region, a geographic area that groups navy installations.
	The stream-graph shows the overall rise in consumption has data starts being tracked, and the eventual
	tapering off as reduction measures are introduced.
